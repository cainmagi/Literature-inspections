# Literature Inspections

This project is a collection of the literature reviews for read papers. I would post the reproductions and codes to this project if I learn a new paper.

## Monte-Carlo research on 02/15/19

This branch contains the source codes for the research on Monte-Carlo method, the original lecture notes could be found here:

[*Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Gibbs Sampling*](http://nitro.biosci.arizona.edu/courses/EEB596/handouts/Gibbs.pdf)

This experiments mainly contains 3 parts:

* `python imp-samp.py`: Error analysis on importance sampling.

* `python metropolis.py`: 2D Simulation for Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and error analysis.

* `python gibbs.py`: 2D Simulation for Gibbs sampling and error analysis.

And report for the review is shown in

[*Stochastic optimization I: from Monte-Carlo methods to Gibbs sampling*](https://cainmagi.github.io/notes/note20190215special/)

Please check this page for more details.
